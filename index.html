                        I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow in computational Biology/Bioinformatics, working in the lab of Dr. Zhongming Zhao at the School of Biomedical Informatics, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston(UTHealth).
                        My research is focused on the application of multivariate statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to mics data, and bioinformatics data, in general.

                    <p>I was born and grown up in China. After receiving a BE degree on Computer Science in 2012, I left for Beijing to pursue a Ph.D. degree in  Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS)& Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) for Computational Biology/Bioinformatics.
                        After receiving my Ph.D. in Medical Science, with a concentration in Bioinformatics, I choiced US to restart our career in September 2017.</p>
